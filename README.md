## A New Software Tool for the Coloured Petri Nets Modelling Language

Coloured Petri Nets is a modelling and simulation language for distributed systems and has been implemented in CPN Tools. CPN Tools has been widely used in in industrial projects, but is also becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Furthermore, recent industrial collaboration has identified need for developing and implementing several extensions of the modelling language.

The aim of this project is to developed the next generation of tool support for CPNs.

A demonstration of the existing CPN Tools:

A short introduction to Coloured Petri Nets can be found in the paper: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/6/187324-colored-petri-nets/abstract

There are several possibilities for practically oriented implementation projects linked to the tool development:

- software frameworks for implementation of graphical editors
- simulation tools
- data-structures and algorithms for verification
- automatic code generation from executable models

The plan is to developed the tool using the .NET platform as basis with C# being used for the implementation of the front-end and F# being used to implement the model execution engine (simulator). Hence, prior knowledge of .NET and C# will be an advantage when undertaking the project.

The master project will be linked to the upcoming SmartOcean centre for research-based innovation which will investigate the use of software modelling, simulation, and verification for developing reliable distributed software that are to be part of smart ocean systems. The practical use of the tool will be evaluated on case studies from the smart ocean project which includes industry partners such as Bouvet, Aanderaa Data Instruments, and Kongsberg Maritime.

## A virtual platform for Cloud-IoT and Smart Software Systems

The aim of this project will be to develop a virtual environment for implementation and deployment of software systems involving Internet-of-things (IoT) devices. The development of IoT systems is challenging since it is difficult to make a comprehensive test of a larger installation involving many devices. While there exists simulators for IoT devices (such as TinkerCAD) these simulation lacks the capability to properly emulate network/cloud connectivity.

A virtual environment for simulation of IoT systems would be of high-relevance for industrial project, but would also be highly applicable as teaching technology in courses on IoT.

## Technology for Programming Course Assignments

The use continious integration technology is finding its way into programming courses as a way to support automated grading. However, the process from development of the assignment to correcting of students assignment still has many manual steps.

The aim of this project will be to develop an integrated solution that supports consistency between assignment text, start code provided to the students, solutions, semi-automated test case generation and autograding with private/public tests.
