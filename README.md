# A New Software Tool for the Coloured Petri Nets Modelling Language

Coloured Petri Nets is a modelling and simulation language for distributed systems and has been implemented in CPN Tools. CPN Tools has been widely used and is currently being used in industrial collaboration projects with Schneider Electric and SCA Solutions. CPN Tools is becoming difficult to maintain and the aim of this project is to developed the next generation of tool support for CPNs. 

A demonstration of the existing CPN Tools: 

A short introduction to Coloured Petri Nets can be found in the paper:

There are several possibilties for practically oriented implementation projects linked to the tool development:

- frameworks for implementation of graphical editors
- simulation tools based on C++, Java, and Scala
- data-structures and algorithms for verification

# Model-based Testing of Distributed Systems Protocols

Testing of distributed system can be challenging and the purpose of this project is to investigate the use of model-based testing as an approach to verify distributed systems protocols.

# Platforms, Frameworks, and Tecnologies for Internet-of-things

The aim of this project will be to look into protocols and software frameworks for building IoT solutions. This may include protocols such as CoAP, MQTT and WebSockets.

# Further Development of the SIMSubsea educational game

HVL has over the past years been involved in developing the SIMSubsea educational game:

The aim of this project is to further development the game in areas such as:

- support for use in engineering education
- web front-end for adding mathematical problems to the game 
- web front-end for competition among multiple players

Knowledge and solid skills in the use of Unity is required to undertake this project.
